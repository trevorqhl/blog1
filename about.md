![Linux](/images/linux.jpeg)

This blog was started on April 18, 2020 during the difficult time from the then ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Schools were close and I decided to teach my kids some Linux and programming. 

While command line Linux seems a bit boring, kids are more interested in visual expereince like building a website. I found Jekyll very easy to learn for creating a static website and hosting it on Github. 

As soon as I started teaching my kids Jekyll, I fell in love with it. I decided to create this blog with Jekyll to share my hands-on Linux experince with my children and hopefully improve the IT skills of my other readers.  

Most of the articles are how to’s about Linux / Unix systems.
