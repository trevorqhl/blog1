![Linux](/images/linux.jpeg)

This blog was created at April 18, 2020 during the difficult time of covid 19 pandemic. Schools were close and my kids stayed home. I decided to teach them some Linux, web and programming. 

While command line Linux seems a bit boring, Kids are more interested in visual expereince like building a website. I found Jekyll is very easy to learn to build a static website and host it on Github. 

As soon as  I started teaching my kids Jekyll, I aslo fell in love with it. I decided to create this blog share my hands-on Linux experince and hopefully improve my readers' IT skills.  

Most of the articles are how toâ€™s about Linux / Unix systems.
