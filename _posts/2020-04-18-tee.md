tee command reads the standard input and writes it to both the standard output and one or more files 
{% highlight ruby %}
# The standard output stream will be copied to the file, it will still be visible in the terminal.
# If the file already exists, it gets overwritten.
salt-call state.highstate | tee highstate.log

# The standard output stream will be copied to the file, it will still be visible in the terminal. 
# If the file already exists, the new data will get appended to the end of the file.
salt-call state.highstate | tee -a highstate.log

# Both the standard output and standard error streams will be copied to the file while still being visible in the terminal. 
# If the file already exists, it gets overwritten.
salt-call state.highstate |& tee highstate.log

# Both the standard output and standard error streams will be copied to the file while still being visible in the terminal. 
# If the file already exists, the new data will get appended to the end of the file.
salt-call state.highstate |& tee -a highstate.log
